# Clustering
I have used Iris flower dataset file. The file Iris.csv consists of 150, 4-dimensional data 
which includes 50 samples from each of the three species of Iris (Iris setose, Iris virginica and Iris 
versicolor). Column 1 to 4 of the given file are the four features (attributes) that were measured 
from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals (in centimetres) respectively.
Column 5 is the class label (species name) associated with each of the samples of Iris flower.
In this repository, I have used K-Means, GMM and DBSCAN to cluster Iris flower dataset and analyzed
which one works better.
